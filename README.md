# Project2-NBA-Salaries

# Overview

NBA players get paid a lot. In fact they get paid the most out of all types of sports. The top 10 paid players in the NBA make over $33million a year.  When a player signs a contract, what criterias does he have to meet to be paid the most? Stephen Curry leads the laegue in 3pt made and is making $40 million, the top scoring player James Harden is being paid $37million a year, the top rebounding player Andre Drummond is being paid $27 million a year, Kemba Walker who doesn’t lead the league in anything is being paid $32 million a year. Does a player get paid more because he scores more?  If so, why does Stephen Curry get paid the most? What determines a player’s salary, and can we predict based on his performance how much he will be paid?   

# Dataset/Features

This project's objective is to determine whether there is a linear relationship between NBA player salary and performance. Performance is measured by basketball statistics in categories. Some of the features included include:  

Minutes played  
Games played  
Points  
Two-pointers  
Three-pointers  
Rebounds  
Turnovers  
Assists  
Steals  
Field Goal Percentage

# Findings

I found that there is somewhat of a linear relationship relationship between player perfomance and salary. However, I also noted that there are a lot of outliers. I believe that this could be due to the "super-star" effect where players that are more popular get paid more. This is becuase they could increase the revenue of the team by increasing viewers or selling merchandise.
